              <p className="title">Who is eligible for the INF Advantage Plan?</p>
              <p>Any Non-US Citizen traveling to the United States can apply for the INF Advantage Plan.

              <p>If your visitors require the same Insurance for Visitors plan, you can add both of them on the same policy. When adding a dependent on to the policy, it does not diminish the coverage. Rather- both visitors will have the same policy maximum and deductible, separately. For instance, if you enroll in a $100,000 coverage plan with $250 deductible with a primary and dependent, each visitor on the policy will be covered individually up to $100,000 and have their own deductible to meet of $250.</p>
