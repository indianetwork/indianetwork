                 <p className="text-black">The beauty of the Careington Dental Discount Plan is that there is no hassle of filing claims or filing for reimbursement from the company. Rather- the Careington card acts as a discount card or instant savings card, meaning you pay the discounted rate at participating dentists.</p>
                 <p className="text-black">For example- you visit a dental office that charges $600 for a root canal that you desperately need. If the dental office participates in the Careington Dental Discount Plan all you need to do is show your Careington Dental Discount card to the front receptionist, you will then get a discounted rate for your procedure. The discounted rate will be the price you pay. Very simple- no need to file for claims or reimbursement- depending on the procedure you can save as much as over 50% of the cost by just showing your card!</p>

                 <p className="text-black">â€‹Many visitors run into some sort of dental issue while outside their home country. In fact, a survey of INF Members in 2018 found that 46% of insured persons who visited the US complained of some sort of dental issue during their visit. A common question we're asked at INF is, "I can't eat anything due to this toothache! What can I do?" According to MemberBenefits.com, the average cost of a regular dental visit is going to be almost $285- let alone the cost of a tooth extraction or new dentures!</p>
