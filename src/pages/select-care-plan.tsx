              <h2 className="text-blue text-center">INF SelectCare Plan: Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

              <p className="title">Who is eligible for the INF SelectCare Plan?</p>
              <p>Any Non-US Citizens traveling to the United States can apply for the INF SelectCare Plan. This includes Green Card holders, H-1B Visa Holders, Permanent Residents, Students on F1 / F1 Visas, those on OTP, and those whose immigration status is not yet confirmed. This plan works for all age groups, from age 0 to age 99+.</p>

              <p className="title">Will the INF SelectCare cover Travel?</p>
              <p>The SelectCare Plan covers travel through any stop over. Whether you are transiting through Dubai, London, or Hong Kong, you will have coverage throughout your journey to the US.  Travel with confidence, provided by INF.</p>

              <p className="title">Should I add my Visitors Spouse as a Dependent?</p>
              <p>If your visitors require the same Insurance for Visitors plan, you can add both of them on the same policy. When adding a dependent on to the policy, it does not diminish the coverage. Rather- both visitors will have the same policy maximum and deductible, separately. For instance, if you enroll in a $100,000 coverage plan with $250 deductible with a primary and dependent, each visitor on the policy will be covered individually up to $100,000 and have their own deductible to meet of $250.</p>

              <p className="title">Will this plan work in my area?</p>
              <p>All INF Plans provide coverage in the United States. There is no need to worry when you are traveling with an INF Plan. The SelectCare Plan offers the option of using the First Health Provider Network. Find a full list of providers here.</p>

              <p className="title">Who underwrites the SelectCare Plan?</p>

              <p className="title">Are the SelectCare Plan's Premiums Pro-Rated?</p>
              <p>Yes. For example, if you apply for 1 month and 5 days - that is the exact amount you pay for. No more, no less. Rates are based on a 30 day calendar and are prorated on that basis.</p>

              <p>The SelectCare Plan can be used with the First Health Provider Network option which provides access to discounted health care services from one of the largest medical networks in the U.S. No longer will you need to pay hospital bills upfront & then submit claims forms, waiting sometimes months for reimbursement.

              <p className="title">Can I renew the SelectCare Plan?</p>
              <p>You are able to renew the SelectCare Plan for any amount of time after the initial coverage period. We send email, text, and phone call reminders to you 1 week & 1 day before the policy expiration.</p>

              <p className="title">Will this plan cover pre-existing conditions?</p>
              <p>The SelectCare Plan does not cover pre-existing conditions. We recommend individuals below 50 years of age who do not have any pre-existing conditions enroll in this program.</p>

              <p className="title">â€‹Can I cancel this plan?</p>

              <p className="title">Who do I reach out to about claims questions?</p>
              <p>Anytime you visit a health care provider, even if you do not pay, we strongly suggest you fill out the INF <Link to="/claims">claim form</Link> so the insurance company has a record of your visit to the health care provider & will be able to pay your claim in a timely manner.</p>
